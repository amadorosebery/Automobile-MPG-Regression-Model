# Automobile-MPG-Regression-Model
In this analysis report we are going to be analyzing different car attributes in order to determine which attributes have the largest impact on a car’s miles per gallon (MPG). In this report we are specifically going to be looking at factors such as: the number of cylinders that a car has, engine displacement, horsepower, the weight of the car, the acceleration of the car, and the year that the car was made. One of the main results that we are trying to figure out is which of these factors have an impact on a car’s miles per gallon. From there we can ask the question: if this factor does impact a car’s miles per gallon, does it increase the miles per gallon or does it decrease the miles per gallon. This dataset was found through the UC Irvine data repository.
